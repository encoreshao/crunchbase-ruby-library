He leads the design of Facebook's service and development of its core technology and infrastructure.

Harvard administration was not amused, and Zuckerberg faced subsequent disciplinary action. Less than three months later, he launched Facebook.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the Newark Public School System to help renovate and revamp the system.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg won the 2007 Crunchie Award for 'Best Startup CEO.'
