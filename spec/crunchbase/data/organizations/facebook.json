It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.","profile_image_url":"http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1502744477/anzcz7nix0gjwho8mfpu.png","primary_role":"company","role_company":true,"role_investor":true,"role_group":false,"role_school":false,"founded_on":"2004-02-04","founded_on_trust_code":7,"is_closed":false,"closed_on":null,"closed_on_trust_code":null,"num_employees_min":10001,"num_employees_max":1000000,"stock_exchange":"NASDAQ","stock_symbol":"FB","total_funding_usd":2335700000,"number_of_investments":9,"homepage_url":"http://www.facebook.com","created_at":1180153335,"updated_at":1503797658},"relationships":{"primary_image":{"cardinality":"OneToOne","paging":{"total_items":0,"first_page_url":"https://api.crunchbase.com/v3/organizations/facebook/primary_image","sort_order":"not_ordered"},"item":{"type":"Image","uuid":"df6628127f970b439d3e12f64f504fbb","properties":{"asset_path":"http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1502744477/anzcz7nix0gjwho8mfpu.png","asset_url":"http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1502744477/anzcz7nix0gjwho8mfpu.png","content_type":"png","height":null,"width":null,"filesize":null,"created_at":1180153335,"updated_at":1503797658}}},"founders":{"cardinality":"OneToMany","paging":{"total_items":5,"first_page_url":"https://api.crunchbase.com/v3/organizations/facebook/founders","sort_order":"not_ordered"},"items":[{"type":"Person","uuid":"084aaa0707951fe89c4698bbeb02cd64","properties":{"permalink":"dustin-moskovitz","api_path":"people/dustin-moskovitz","web_path":"person/dustin-moskovitz","api_url":"https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/dustin-moskovitz","first_name":"Dustin","last_name":"Moskovitz","gender":"Male","also_known_as":null,"bio":"Dustin

His primary operating company is Hutchison Whampoa Limited.  Mr Li's younger son, Richard, is Chairman of PCCW, one of Asia's leading internet and telecommunications companies.\r\n\r\nMr Li Ka-shing is the Chairman of Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited and Hutchison Whampoa Limited. Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited is the flagship of the Cheung Kong Group which has business operations in 54 countries around the world and employs about 240,000 staff. In Hong Kong alone, the Group includes nine listed companies with a combined market capitalization of approximately HKD600 billion (30 June 2009). Hutchison Whampoa Limited is a Fortune Global 500 company.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1928 in Chiu Chow, a coastal city in the southeastern part of China, Mr Li fled to Hong Kong with his family to avoid the perils of war. His father suffered from tuberculosis and passed away in Hong Kong. Shouldering the responsibility of looking after the livelihood of the family, Mr Li was forced to leave school before the age of 15 and found a job in a plastics trading company where he labored 16 hours a day. By 1950, his hard work, prudence and his pursuit of excellence had enabled him to start his own company, Cheung Kong Industries. From manufacturing plastics, Mr Li led and developed his company into a leading real estate investment company in Hong Kong that was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. Cheung Kong continued to expand by acquiring Hutchison Whampoa and Hongkong Electric Holdings Limited in 1979 and 1985 respectively.\r\n\r\nBased in Hong Kong, the Cheung Kong Group's businesses encompass such diverse areas as property development and investment, real estate agency and estate management, hotels, telecommunications and e-commerce, finance and investments, retail, ports and related services, energy, infrastructure projects and materials, media, and biotechnology. Mr Li is a strong believer in synergy — the power of combined efforts.

His primary operating company is Hutchison Whampoa Limited.  Mr Li's younger son, Richard, is Chairman of PCCW, one of Asia's leading internet and telecommunications companies.\r\n\r\nMr Li Ka-shing is the Chairman of Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited and Hutchison Whampoa Limited. Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited is the flagship of the Cheung Kong Group which has business operations in 54 countries around the world and employs about 240,000 staff. In Hong Kong alone, the Group includes nine listed companies with a combined market capitalization of approximately HKD600 billion (30 June 2009). Hutchison Whampoa Limited is a Fortune Global 500 company.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1928 in Chiu Chow, a coastal city in the southeastern part of China, Mr Li fled to Hong Kong with his family to avoid the perils of war. His father suffered from tuberculosis and passed away in Hong Kong. Shouldering the responsibility of looking after the livelihood of the family, Mr Li was forced to leave school before the age of 15 and found a job in a plastics trading company where he labored 16 hours a day. By 1950, his hard work, prudence and his pursuit of excellence had enabled him to start his own company, Cheung Kong Industries. From manufacturing plastics, Mr Li led and developed his company into a leading real estate investment company in Hong Kong that was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. Cheung Kong continued to expand by acquiring Hutchison Whampoa and Hongkong Electric Holdings Limited in 1979 and 1985 respectively.\r\n\r\nBased in Hong Kong, the Cheung Kong Group's businesses encompass such diverse areas as property development and investment, real estate agency and estate management, hotels, telecommunications and e-commerce, finance and investments, retail, ports and related services, energy, infrastructure projects and materials, media, and biotechnology. Mr Li is a strong believer in synergy — the power of combined efforts. This belief is reflected in his naming his company Cheung Kong Holdings after the Yangtze River that flows through China, a great river that aggregates countless streams and tributaries. The Times in the United Kingdom and Ernst & Young UK jointly named Mr Li as the Entrepreneur of the Millennium at the turn of the century.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/eng/about/chairman/chairman.htm \r\n30 June 2009","profile_image_url":"http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1468588543/duyth4hmy5sbbvu0tqwy.png","role_investor":true,"born_on":"1928-01-01","born_on_trust_code":7,"died_on":null,"died_on_trust_code":null,"created_at":1196418396,"updated_at":1503797864}}]}}]}},{"type":"FundingRound","uuid":"c26d2da69801e1632ded617dcd0a9a65","properties":{"permalink":"c26d2da69801e1632ded617dcd0a9a65","api_path":"funding-rounds/c26d2da69801e1632ded617dcd0a9a65","web_path":"funding-round/c26d2da69801e1632ded617dcd0a9a65","api_url":"https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/funding-rounds/c26d2da69801e1632ded617dcd0a9a65","funding_type":"venture","series":"C","series_qualifier":null,"announced_on":"2007-10-24","announced_on_trust_code":7,"closed_on":null,"closed_on_trust_code":null,"money_raised":240000000,"money_raised_currency_code":"USD","money_raised_usd":240000000,"target_money_raised":null,"target_money_raised_currency_code":null,"target_money_raised_usd":null,"created_at":1193245076,"updated_at":1503793245},"relationships":{"investments":[{"type":"Investment","uuid":"3dcca1974a72a1d3fbdead4fa5429b66","properties":{"money_invested":null,"money_invested_currency_code":null,"money_invested_usd":null,"is_lead_investor":true,"announced_on":"2007-10-24","announced_on_trust_code":7,"created_at":1193245076,"updated_at":1467315822},"relationships":{"investors":{"type":"Organization","uuid":"fd80725f53fc70099878aeecf1e9ffbb","properties":{"permalink":"microsoft","api_path":"organizations/microsoft","web_path":"organization/microsoft","api_url":"https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/microsoft","name":"Microsoft","also_known_as":["msn"],"short_description":"Microsoft, a software corporation that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells a range of software products and services.","description":"Microsoft is an American multinational corporation that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells a range of software products and services.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s devices and consumer (D&C) licensing segment licenses Windows operating system and related software; Microsoft Office for consumers; and Windows Phone operating system.
