He leads the design of Facebook's service and development of its core technology and infrastructure. Mark studied computer science at Harvard University before moving the company to Palo Alto, California.\r\n\r\nEarlier in life, Zuckerberg developed a music recommendation system called Synapse and a peer-to-peer client called Wirehog. However, he abandoned both to pursue new projects.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg attended Harvard University and studied computer science before founding Facebook.\r\n\r\nWhile at Harvard, Zuckerberg created Facemash, a website that compared students' dorm photos side-by-side in a fashion similar to HOT or NOT. Harvard administration was not amused, and Zuckerberg faced subsequent disciplinary action. Less than three months later, he launched Facebook.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the Newark Public School System to help renovate and revamp the system.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg won the 2007 Crunchie Award for 'Best Startup CEO.' He was the Time Magazine 2010 Person Of The Year. He also won the 2012 Crunchie Award for CEO of the year.",
