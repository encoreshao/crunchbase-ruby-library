His dissertation, \"Characterizing World Wide Web Ecologies\" was one of the earliest dedicated towards empirically understanding the dynamics of the Web. Jim helped pioneer the field of online surveying by creating GVU's WWW User Surveys. His research paper, \"Characterizing Browsing Strategies in the World-Wide Web\" is the basis for online analytics and continues to invalidate tens of millions of dollars of patent lawsuits.\r\n\r\nJim graduated Cum Laude in Psychology from the University of Colorado.

Since then, he's gone on to create dozens of apps which have been downloaded over 3 million times worldwide, featured on CNN, ABC News, Univision, Telemundo, CNN en Español, Reuters, Sky News, and has spoken and given conferences to thousands of college students at various universities across the country and many other universities internationally. These apps have reached the top 20 most downloaded apps in the entire App Store, above million dollar apps such as Candy Crush, Pinterest, Tumblr, Angry Birds, LinkedIn, and even Twitter. Michael's apps have gotten the attention of many large companies including Zynga, Coca-Cola, and Facebook. Additionally, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, also requested to meet him at the Facebook HQ in November of 2013. He also met with their university recruiting team (although he was still in high school) to talk about potential partnerships and employment opportunities (currently interning at Facebook). Although he programs the apps, he sees himself as more of an entrepreneur than a computer scientist.\r\n\r\nAnyone can make a complex app, but to know the strategies of reaching the top each and every time, that's totally different. It may seem like pure luck, but it's not. It's all about analyzing the target audience and picturing the app in their hands.\r\n\r\nMichael was in a private high school thanks to his efforts in paying for his own tuition. He may be only 17 years old, but that doesn't stop him!",
